  Ownership Infrastructure for Cocktail Culture

 <p class="hero-lede">
        Crypto Cocktail Club is building ownership infrastructure for cocktail culture —
        aligning creators, venues, and members through on-chain access, real-world redemption,
        and programmable incentives.

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Cocktail culture generates enduring economic and cultural value, yet the people
        who create it rarely participate in the upside. Recipes circulate freely.
        Venues profit episodically. Loyalty rewards consumption, not contribution.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Crypto Cocktail Club exists to realign cocktail culture so creators, venues,
        and members all participate in its value — transparently, sustainably,
        and without speculation-first incentives.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="block">
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <ul class="principles">
        <li><strong>Membership NFTs</strong> — Scarce access passes with evolving utility</li>
        <li><strong>Redeemable Cocktail IP</strong> — On-chain recipes with real-world use</li>
        <li><strong>Venue Network</strong> — Bars monetize culture beyond the four walls</li>
      </ul>

<div class="card">
  <h3>Access as Infrastructure</h3>
  <p>
    Membership NFTs are not collectibles.
    They are programmable access credentials that gate experiences,
    redemption rights, and future protocol participation.

    <p class="section-subtitle">
      Incentive coordination layer
    </p>

    <p class="section-copy">
      TIPZ is the incentive and settlement mechanism that aligns creators,
      venues, and members inside the Crypto Cocktail Club protocol.
    </p>

    <p class="section-copy">
      TIPZ is <strong>earned through participation</strong> — by contributing recipes,
      hosting redemptions, supporting venues, or engaging with protocol experiences.
    </p>

    <p class="section-copy">
      The token exists to reward real activity and to coordinate value flow
      between off-chain hospitality and on-chain infrastructure.
    </p>

    <div class="protocol-divider"></div>

    <p class="section-copy">
      TIPZ is not positioned as a speculative asset or consumer payment rail.
      It is designed to function quietly in the background,
      reinforcing behavior rather than driving attention.

    <h3 class="callout-title">Why TIPZ Is Not a Payment Token</h3>

    <ul class="callout-list">
      <li>Bars already operate on mature payment rails.</li>
      <li>Volatile consumer payments create operational risk.</li>
      <li>Hospitality margins do not tolerate speculation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="section-copy">
      TIPZ is designed to <strong>coordinate incentives</strong>, not replace POS systems.
      Settlement into stable rails can occur off-chain where appropriate,
      preserving operational simplicity for venues.

    <h2 class="section-title">Founding Thesis</h2>

    <p class="section-copy">
      Cocktail culture is built by individuals — bartenders, creators,
      and operators — yet ownership of that culture has historically
      accrued elsewhere.
    </p>

    <p class="section-copy">
      Recipes travel faster than the people who create them.
      Venues profit from differentiation.
      Guests participate in culture without participating in its upside.
    </p>

    <div class="protocol-divider"></div>

    <p class="section-copy">
      Crypto Cocktail Club exists to introduce <strong>ownership primitives</strong>
      to hospitality — without disrupting what already works.
    </p>

    <p class="section-copy">
      By treating cocktails as intellectual property,
      experiences as access-controlled systems,
      and venues as network participants,
      CCC reframes nightlife as infrastructure.
